### 10. Writing Your Own Extension

- [Extension Examples](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/samples)



## Edit like a Pro

### 1. Multi-cursor

Allows you to have multiple active cursors that all respond to your keystrokes. Each cursor can also copy/paste its own buffer.

`Alt + Click`  - will add an additional cursor
`Cmd + D` will select the next instance of the text that you have selected with an additional cursor
`Shift + Cmd + L` will select all instances of the text that you have selected with cursors for each
From the Command Palette you can also select a block of lines and choose to "Add Cursors to Line Ends"

Moving around with `Alt + Left` or `Alt + Right` and selecting with the `Shift` modifier is useful in scenarios where you want each cursor to copy a separate piece of text.


### 2. Refactoring

`Ctrl + Shift + R` - VS Code supports a number of refactoring options. One that I use often is to select a string, and choose to turn it into a constant. You can also select blocks of code and refactor into a method along with a number of other options.

`F2` - Rename symbol. When you select a symbol name (argument, properties, variable, function, etc.) and choose to Rename symbol it will allow you to rename all instances of it in the current scope (so much better than a find/replace).

### 3. Move line up/down

`Alt + Up` or `Alt + Down` - move a line up or down (without having to cut and paste it).

### 4. Folding / Unfolding

`Cmd + K + 1, 2, 3, 4` - Fold all of the code at a certain level. Sometimes useful in files to collapse the low-level details, while you get an overview and then dig into the specific area that you need to change. I like to use this in test files.
`Cmd + K, Cmd + J` - Unfold all of the code

### 5. Undo Cursor Position

`Cmd + U` - brings you back to the last place that you edited
`Ctrl + -` - cycles through recent places that you were editing

### 6. Creating Files / Deep Path

When creating a new file from the file explorer, you can type a deep path (`/src/app/data/index.js`) and it will create necessary directories along the way.

### 7. Problems

Extensions (like ESLint) can contribute to a list of problems in a file. When problems are found, the file turns red in the file explorer and you can see red in the gutter of the file where the problems exist.

`Shift + Cmd + M` - opens the problem list to see all problems in a file
`F8` - cycles through the problems

### 8. Comparing Two Files

`Cmd + Click` on two files in the file explorer and right-click on either to choose "Compare Selected". This allows you to diff any two files in your project.

## Navigate Like a Missile

### 1. Find in File / Global

`Cmd + F` - find in a file
`Shift + Cmd + F` - find globally
Can add choose whether match is case sensitive, matches partial words, or to use a regular expression.
You can include specific folders (maybe only sometimes search `./node_modules`) or you can unclick the blue box on the gear for files to exclude and it will search all files.

### 2. Find All References / Peek + GoTo Definition

`Shift + F12` - Find all references - find all the places where a function is called (traces dependencies through your files).
`F12` - Go To Definition - jump to where a function is defined
`Alt + F12` - Peek Definition  - show an inline view of the function definition

Also, you can hold down `Cmd` and hover over a function and see a small peek into the definition above and `Cmd + Click` to navigate to the definition.

### 3. Basic Navigation in a File

`Cmd + Up` - Top of file
`Cmd + Down` - Bottom of file
`Cmd + Left` - Beginning of line
`Cmd + Right` - End of line
`Alt + Left` - Move word by word to the left on a line
`Alt + Right` - Move word by word to the right on a line

Add `Shift` modifier to any of the above to select while moving

`Ctrl + G` - Go to a specific line in the file

### 4. Splitting / Moving Windows

`Cmd + \` to split the window

Can find other splits like splitting down (and bind to keys as necessary|) in the Command Palette.

### 5. Navigating Between Windows

`Cmd + 1` to go to first set of tabs. `Cmd + 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.` to move to additional sets of tabs.
`Ctrl + Tab` navigate between files in a group.

### 6. Navigating Symbols

`Shift + Cmd + O` - navigate between symbols (methods, properties, variables, etc.) in a file.
`Cmd + T` navigate between symbols for your entire project. 
Much faster than searching or scrolling and provides good context (variable vs. method).

## Master your shortcuts

### 1. Command Palette

`Shift + Cmd + P` - Access to almost anything that you can do in the editor (and you can see keyboard shortcuts)

### 2. Explorer

`Cmd + P` - Open/find files in your project. Type a `?` to see other modes that you use for searching.

### 3. Toggle Sidebar

`Cmd + B` - Toggle open/closed the sidebar. On a smaller screen, you can save space by closing it and using Cmd + P to open files.

### 6. Minimap

The minimap is a small overview of your file in the gutter. Use the Command Palette (search for "minimap") to toggle this on/off.

### 7. Terminal

`Ctrl + ~` - Open a terminal in the root directory of the project that you are editing. Can split the terminal and move it between being docked on the bottom or side.

### 8. Calling code from command-line

`code --help` - From a terminal, you can run the `code` command-line tool. The most common use of this would be to open the current directory that your terminal is in (perhaps after cloning a repo or creating a new project).

## Customizing VS Code

### 1. Settings

`Cmd + ,` - Access all of the settings. Override at a user (all instances of VS Code for your user) or workspace level (this instance of VS Code). Workspace settings are saved either in the `.vscode` folder when you are editing a single directory or when using Workspaces they are saved in the single workspace file.

### 2. Font With Ligature

A popular choice is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). After installing, you will want to update your VS Code settings `"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code", "editor.fontLigatures": true`.


## Snippets

### 1. Creating Snippets

Go to `Code > Preferences > User Snippets` to edit your snippets. You can define snippets at a global level or per language (most common). 

Some sample snippets:

```
	"Print var to console": {
		"prefix": "logv",
		"body": [
			"console.log( \"$1\", $1 );",
			"$2"
		],
		"description": "Log a variable to console"
	}
 ```

This snippet is accessed when typing `logv` and then tabbing. The first tab stop will create two cursors with one in the quotes and one in the second argument. This allows you to type a variable name and hit tab again to move to the next line of code.

Here is one that I use in testing:

```
"calledOnce.and.calledWith": {
		"prefix": "shc",
		"body": [
			"$1.should.be.called${2|Once,Twice,Thrice|}",
			"	.and.calledWith( $3 );",
			"$4"
		]
	}
```

In this one, I can type a variable name and then choose between `Once`, `Twice`, or `Thrice` before moving to assert the arguments that it was called with.

For testing (mocha), I often use simple snippets as well:

```
"describe": {
		"prefix": "des",
		"body": [
			"describe( \"$1\", () => {",
			"	$2",
			"} );",
			""
		]
	},
	"it": {
		"prefix": "itt",
		"body": [
			"it( \"$1\", () => {",
			"	$2",
			"} );",
			""
		]
	},
	"beforeEach": {
		"prefix": "bef",
		"body": [
			"beforeEach( () => {",
			"	$1",
			"} );",
			""
		]
	}
  ```

## Node

### 1. Debug a Node Program

VS Code is known for how well it can debug problems like those running in Node. When going to the debug tab of the sidebar, you can define a run configuration by clicking the gear icon. 

Common choices for debugging node would be to:
`Launch Program` - launch and debug your program directly from VS Code
`Attach by Process ID` - allows you to pick a process running on your machine to attach to (run program like `node --inspect index.js` to allow attaching or `node --inspect-brk index.js` to force the program to wait until the debugger attaches
`Attach to Remote Program` - allows you to specific an `address` and `post` to attach to a program running remotely (perhaps in a docker container on your machine).

The launch configurations support a variety of properties to configure your debugging experience that are futher described in the documentation:
